    "## Introduction\n",
    "Game theory plays a large role in the analysis of human behaviors. It has various applications in fields like economics, politics, biology, computer science, philosophy, and many more. Game theory formally began with a paper written by John von Neumann, a Hungarian-American mathematician. This paper then became a centerpiece for game theory and mathematical economics. The scope of game theory was then widened with the emergence of the Cold War. In 1950, the RAND Corporation ran mathematical discussions and experiments on the prisoner’s dilemma, a game problem that we will be further exploring in this write-up, in order to develop applications into nuclear strategy. It was soon after that John Nash developed a revolutionary criterion for player strategies called the Nash Equilibrium. We will explore how best to decide on strategies and actions to take for a player in some two-player games. First, we will walk through the fundamentals of game theory and begin finding solutions for the prisoner's dilemma. We will talk more about strategy types and how to find them through the use of Nash Equilibrium. Afterwards we will explore optimal strategies for a variation on rock paper scissors and will end with a variation on prisoners dilemma with a focus on cooperative play. "

    "## Background\n",
    "#### Games and Game Theory\n",
    "In the most basic sense, a game is a relational model of actions and results taken by players for the purpose of incentive. Players are given a set of actions that can be taken, each with a resulting outcome. These actions are used by the players to further their progress towards a goal. In each game, a player can have a strategy, or set of moves, that will allow them to progress further than if they played normally. The fundamental principle of game theory is to discover these strategies. More formally, game theory is the mathematical modeling of the consequences of conflicts, cooperations, and actions between players. A player’s set of actions can lead to a variety of different outcomes. For most basic games, the costs/benefits of the outcomes that arise can be modeled in a payoff matrix. This matrix, also known as Normal Form, indicates the utility or payoff that the player can gain from playing each possible action against an opponent. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most prominent games studied by game theorists is the prisoner’s dilemma. The rules of which are:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They hope to get both sentenced to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutor's offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to: betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The maximum prison sentence of the crime is 5 years. The offer is:\n",
    "- If A and B each betray the other, each of them get 1 year taken off their prison sentence \n",
    "- If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve the full 5 years in prison (and vice versa)\n",
    "- If A and B both remain silent, both of them will take off 3 years from their prison sentence (on the lesser charge)  \n",

    "## Mathematical Model\n",
    "#### Defining Terms and Notations \n",
    "In the following parts of the report, we will be using some new notations to define our problems. In game theory, there are two main types of strategies that are analyzed: Pure and Mixed. Pure strategies are very straight-forward. In a <b>pure strategy</b>, a players selects a single strategy and plays it. Each row or column of a payoff matrix represents both an action and a pure strategy. In a <b>mixed strategy</b>, you randomize over the set of available actions and choose one. Before going further into developing strategies, we should define some notations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let there be an $n$ number of players, player-$1$, player-$2$, … , player-$n$. \n",
    "- A <b>strategy profile</b> is a set of n strategies, one strategy played by each player. This is defined as $S = (s_{1}, … , s_{n})$. \n",
    "- A <b>action profile</b> is a set of n actions, one action taken by each player. This is defined as $A = (a_{1}, … , a_{n})$. \n",
    "- <b>Utility</b> is the payoff of taking a certain action or strategy. This is defined by $U$. \n",
    "- Let $p_{i}(a_{j})$ = the probability that action $a_{j}$ will be played in a mixed strategy $i$.\n",
    "- <b>Expected utility</b> or the expected payoff of a mixed strategy for player $i$ can be defined as a function $U_{i}$\n",
    "\t- If $S$ = ($s_{1}$, … , $s_{n}$) is a mixed strategy profile\n",
    "\t- For every action profile ($a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, … , $a_{n}$), multiply it’s probability and utility. \n",
    "<center>$U_{i}(a_{1}, a_{2}, … , a_{n})*p_{1}(a_{1}) * p_{2}(a_{2}) * … * p_{n}(a_{n})$</center>  \n",
    "    - The total expected utility for player $i$ is: \n",
    "<center>$U_{i}(s_{1}, … s_{n}) = \\sum\\limits_{(a_{1}, … , a_{n})\\in A} U_{i}(a_{1}, … , a_{n})*p_{1}(a_{1}) * … * p_{n}(a_{n})$</center>  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Dominant Strategy Equilibrium\n",
    "In a general game, there are multiple possible strategies for a player. For a strategy to be good, it must maximize the player’s utility, also known as the reward. We can represent utility as a function $U_{i}(s_{i})$ which is a player $i$’s utility from strategy $s_{i}$. We let $S_{i}$ = {the set of all possible strategies for a player-$i$} and $s_{i}$ refers to a strategy in $S_{i}$. A strategy $s_{i}$ (contained in $S_{i}$) dominates if with it player-$i$ always does better or equally as well than with another strategy $s_{i}^{*}$ (so only if $U_{i}(s_{i}) \\geq U_{i}(s_{i}^{*})$). $s_{i}$ is the dominant strategy if it is better than all $s_{i}^{*} \\in S_{i}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our prisoner’s dilemma problem is formally classified as an imperfect-information non-zero-sum problem. Imperfect-information meaning that neither players will know what the other player will do until after both players have taken an action. It is non-zero-sum in contrast to a zero-sum game where players benefit only at an equal expense of another. The payoff matrix for this game is:  \n",

    "#### Nash Equilibrium\n",
    "Nash Equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his or her own strategy. In other words, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible, taking into account the decisions of the others in the game as long as the other party's decision remains unchanged. We can model the Nash Equilibrium through a linear programming maximin problem. This is a problem where you want to maximize the lower bound of the expected utility you can gain.  \n",

    "#### Minimax and Maximin\n",
    "The Nash Equilibrium formally defined as a Linear Programming Minimax/Maximin problem. In a minimax problem, you want to minimize your losses. In a game where a benefit to the player results in a loss for the opponent, this means setting up a upper bound on the utility your opponent gets, allowing you to lower the value they are sure to get, thereby limiting their potential for points. In a maximin problem, you want to maximize the lower bound on your score, allowing you to increase the value you are sure to get, thereby increasing your potential for points. To model this, we should first define some terms.  \n",

If you tell the truth but lose, there is no additional penalty (so you just lose 1 point). If you lie (i.e. declare “Rock” but play “Scissors”) and win, you don’t get any bonus points (so you gain just 1 point). If you and your opponent tell the truth and you lose (i.e. they declare “Paper” and play “Paper” while you declare “Rock” and play “Rock”), then you lose 1 additional point (so you lose 2 points total) .

The game is played in rounds, where the prisoners are each paired off with each other and play the coordination game (Ally/Betray). Thus, one round consists of 10 games, with each prisoner meeting each other prisoner once.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the normal prisoner's dilemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If A and B each 'Betray' the other, each receives 0 points\n",
    "- If A and B 'Ally' with each other, each receives 2 points\n",
    "- If A 'Betray's B, but B 'Ally's, A gains 3 points and B loses 2 points, and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional conditions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All players begin with 3 points\n",
    "- Once a player reaches 9 points, they may press the \"Escape\" button and all players with 9 or more points may leave\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is a catch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As soon as a player leaves, all players with less than 9 points immediately die\n",
    "- There is one \"evil\" player that everyone is aware of, with a 50% chance to betray. They will press the button immediately upon reaching 9 points\n",
    "- Players cannot identify each other when playing the coordination game\n",
    "\n",
    "Point totals are calculated in parallel at the end of the round. It is assumed that all but the \"evil\" player are cooperative to the group's survival. Thus, your goal in this problem is to have all cooperative prisoners escape.  If no prisoner has won by the time a round has finished, a new round will start.  The utility matrix for an individual game is shown below:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "On a more profound note, the difference between these two games is betrayal versus altruism.  Could the implication be that being good doesn't pay?\n",
    "\n",
    "More seriously, game theory is a very well defined subset of economics, but its applications aren't necessarily stale.  In the end, the goal is to break down a challenge in order to construct a better one, and that is exactly what was done here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using our findings from applying Nash Equilibrium to a series of games and situations. As we can see from optimization through Nash Equilibrium, by using minimax theorem, we can optimize two player's strategies against eachother and find an equilibrium point for the game. For our prisoner's dilemma, we find the equilibrium to be having both players betray. In a cooperative play however, things change. \n",
    "\n",
    "By assigning a \"Stag Hunt\" ultimatum to an iterated prisoner's dilemma we can observe a difference in collaborative utility, outside of the standard decision matrix.  One might argue than in a populous setting, a tit-for-tat strategy would be more appropriate than a pure strategy, however we find that is not the case.  Strategy is a function of utility, but utility might not always be a function of strict gains.  "
